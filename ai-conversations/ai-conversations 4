Topic: Designing the main menu

Me: I want to make a main menu so users can choose between asking questions or viewing charts. Should I use ipywidgets or a simple text menu?

AI: It depends. ipywidgets makes it look modern and interactive, but it might complicate things if you’re using Google Colab or saving to GitHub. A text-based menu using `pyinputplus` is simpler and runs everywhere.

Me: I was thinking of keeping it minimal with options like:
1 - Ask question  
2 - Temperature chart  
3 - Rainfall chart  
4 - Wind chart  
5 - Exit

AI: That’s a great structure. Use a `while True` loop so the menu keeps appearing after each selection until the user exits.

Me: Got it. I’ll stick to the text version for reliability.

Summary:  
This chat finalized the structure of the Weather Wise main menu using a loop-based command interface instead of ipywidgets for better compatibility and simplicity.
