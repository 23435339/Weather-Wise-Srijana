Topic: Creating weather charts

Me: I have weather data from wttr.in. How can I show it visually for my assignment?

AI: You can use Matplotlib to generate charts. A bar chart works well for temperature, a blue-shaded bar for rainfall, and a smooth line or area chart for wind speed.

Me: I already have daily maximum and minimum temperatures. How do I make the chart look more realistic?

AI: You can create grouped bars for each day — one for min and one for max temperature. Add color themes that match the weather, like orange for warmth and blue for coolness. Label the bars with temperature values using `plt.text()` for clarity.

Me: That’s great. I’ll use different colors for each weather feature. Should I use the same style for rain and wind?

AI: Not exactly. Use a vertical bar chart for rainfall, and an area or line plot for wind — it shows flow and variation better.

Summary:  
This discussion helped design three distinct weather visualizations using Matplotlib: a dual-bar temperature chart, rainfall bars with blue intensity, and a smooth area plot for wind speed.
