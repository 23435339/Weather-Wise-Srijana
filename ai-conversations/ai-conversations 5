Topic: Fixing the notebook error caused by widgets

Me: I tried using ipywidgets for my menu, but when I saved my Colab notebook to GitHub, it showed an error: “metadata.widgets state key missing.” How can I fix it?

AI: That’s a common Colab issue. ipywidgets store extra UI state inside notebook metadata, which GitHub doesn’t always recognize. You can remove that section by cleaning the notebook metadata before saving:
!jupyter nbconvert --ClearMetadataPreprocessor.enabled=True your_notebook.ipynb --to notebook --output cleaned.ipynb

Me: That makes sense, but it’s a bit too much for this project. Maybe I should just use a normal loop-based menu instead.

AI: Exactly. A simple `while True` text menu avoids widget dependencies and works perfectly on GitHub and any Python environment.

Me: Great, I’ll keep the simple version. It’s stable and meets the assignment requirements.

Summary:  
This conversation resolved the notebook widget metadata error and confirmed the decision to keep a plain text-based interface instead of using ipywidgets.
